# Password_Generator

I set up my variables to generate Button command, lower and uppercase letters, numbers and special characteristics

I created a function to write a new password. Created a variable for "password" and gave it the value of "generatePassword()"

I created password text, then I created a value as "password". Then I console.log "Enter Password" and " User Input.

I created a function to generate a new password and set the critera of 8 between 128. 

Then I confirmed the rest of the options for the User password. 

MY PASSWORD GENERATOR BUTTON WAS WORKING SMOOTHLY, HOWEVER I CHANGED SOMETHING IN THE CODE AND COULD NOT GET THE ALERT (PROMPT) TO COME BACK. BUT OTHER THAN THAT CODE IS WRITTEN. COULD NOT FIND A WAY TO DEBUG "RETURN NULL"
